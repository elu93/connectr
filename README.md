They Said So API

# Approach
The approach I used was to build MVP. I focused my efforts on getting the functionality down and using the fundamentals of React to build my app. The challenge was consolidating the lifecycle components with React router and then passing down state/props while communicating with Express.

After completing MVP, I focused on styling and creating a good user experience and then added an API that complemented the app.

# Unsolved Problems
Could not get full CRUD on second and third models.

# Notes to Self
Took on too much technical debt while using React. Next time, I will use cleaner code.
